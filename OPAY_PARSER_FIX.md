# OPay PDF Parser Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

The PDF parser was incorrectly detecting OPay statements as "uba" bank due to:

1. **Substring matching**: The address "Olaniyan street,Yaba" contains "uba" which triggered UBA detection
2. **Detection order**: UBA patterns were checked before OPay patterns
3. **Limited OPay patterns**: Missing key indicators like "Wallet Account & Savings Account"

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Bank Detection (`detectBankType`)

**Fixed patterns**:
- **OPay**: Added "Wallet Account & Savings Account" pattern
- **UBA**: Made patterns more specific (" UBA ", "UBA Bank", "United Bank for Africa")
- **Priority**: OPay patterns are now checked first

**Added debugging**:
- Logs all pattern matching attempts
- Shows which indicators are found/not found
- Traces detection decision process

### 2. Improved OPay Transaction Parsing (`parseOPayPDF`)

**Enhanced detection**:
- Added multiple date format support (dd/MM/yyyy, yyyy-MM-dd, etc.)
- Improved transaction section detection
- Better amount pattern recognition (DR/CR, +/-, with/without ₦)

**Better logging**:
- Shows 20 sample lines instead of 10
- Logs transaction section detection
- Traces parsing attempts and results

### 3. Enhanced Transaction Extraction (`extractOPayTransaction`)

**Multiple date formats**:
- `2025 Jul 14` (yyyy MMM d)
- `14 Jul 2025` (d MMM yyyy)  
- `14/07/2025` (d/M/yyyy)
- `2025-07-14` (yyyy-MM-dd)

**Multiple amount patterns**:
- `+₦76,695.00` / `-₦76,695.00`
- `₦+76,695.00` / `₦-76,695.00`
- `+76,695.00` / `-76,695.00`
- `₦76,695.00 DR` / `₦76,695.00 CR`
- `76,695.00 DR` / `76,695.00 CR`

## Expected Debug Output Now

With these fixes, you should see:

```
=== BANK DETECTION DEBUG ===
Text sample for detection: [first 1000 chars]
Checking OPay patterns...
  "OPay": false
  "OWealth Balance": true
Detected bank: opay

=== OPAY PDF PARSING ===
Total lines: 271
Sample lines:
Line 1: "End Date"
...
Line 16: "Wallet Account & Savings Account"
...
Found potential transaction section at line X: "[transaction header]"
Found potential transaction at line Y: "[transaction data]"
```

## What Should Work Now

1. **Correct Bank Detection**: Should detect as "opay" instead of "uba"
2. **Transaction Extraction**: Should find and parse OPay transactions
3. **Better Error Messages**: More specific debugging if parsing still fails

## Testing the Fix

The next upload should show:
- `Detected bank type: opay` (not uba)
- OPay-specific parsing debug output
- Successful transaction extraction (count > 0)

## Fallback Plan

If OPay parsing still fails, the enhanced debugging will show:
- Exactly which lines are being checked
- Why transaction patterns aren't matching
- Specific format issues to address

This will allow for rapid iteration to fix any remaining format issues specific to your OPay statement layout.

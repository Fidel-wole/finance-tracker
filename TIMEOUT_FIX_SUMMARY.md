# Bank Statement Processing Timeout Fix

## Problem Analysis

The system was experiencing timeout issues due to:

1. **OpenAI API Timeouts**: 8-second timeouts per AI call were causing cascading delays
2. **Concurrent API Calls**: Making parallel calls to categorize and extract merchant info overwhelmed the API
3. **Poor Circuit Breaker Logic**: Circuit breaker wasn't considering total processing time
4. **Aggressive Overall Timeout**: 2-minute timeout was too short for large datasets
5. **Inefficient Batch Processing**: Large batch sizes and concurrent processing caused API rate limiting

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. AI Service Optimizations (`src/services/ai.ts`)

- **Reduced AI timeouts** from 8 seconds to 5 seconds for faster failure
- **Optimized OpenAI parameters**:
  - Reduced max_tokens from 100 to 50
  - Set temperature to 0 for more deterministic responses
  - Added client-level timeout of 4 seconds
- **Better error handling** with immediate fallback on timeout

### 2. Smart Categorization for Large Datasets (`src/services/bank-statement.ts`)

#### Enhanced `smartCategorizeTransactions` method:
- **Limited AI processing**: Max 50 unique transactions with AI, rest use fallback
- **Sequential processing**: Process category and merchant calls sequentially instead of parallel
- **Time-based circuit breaker**: 1-minute timeout for AI processing phase
- **Stricter failure threshold**: Circuit breaker activates after 3 consecutive failures
- **Reduced batch size**: From 3 to 2 transactions per batch
- **Better progress tracking**: Shows AI vs fallback processing counts

#### Enhanced `categorizeTransactions` method for smaller datasets:
- **Limited AI calls**: Max 30 transactions with AI for medium datasets
- **Sequential API calls**: Category and merchant processing one after another
- **Reduced retries**: From 2 to 1 retry per transaction
- **Smaller batches**: From 10 to 5 transactions per batch
- **Brief pauses**: 300ms between API calls to prevent rate limiting

### 3. Controller Timeout Adjustment (`src/controllers/bank-statement.ts`)

- **Increased overall timeout** from 2 minutes to 5 minutes
- **Updated timeout message** to reflect new duration

### 4. Processing Strategy by Dataset Size

| Dataset Size | Strategy | AI Calls | Fallback |
|--------------|----------|----------|----------|
| â‰¤ 100 transactions | Regular categorization | Up to 30 | Remaining |
| > 100 transactions | Smart categorization | Up to 50 unique | Remaining |

## Expected Performance Improvements

1. **Faster Failures**: 5-second AI timeouts instead of 8 seconds
2. **Reduced API Load**: Sequential calls instead of parallel
3. **Better Resource Management**: Limited AI calls prevent overwhelming the API
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback categorization ensures processing always completes
5. **Predictable Processing Time**: Circuit breakers prevent runaway processing

## Fallback Categorization

When AI processing fails or is skipped, the system uses:
- **Basic rule-based categorization**: Pattern matching for common transaction types
- **Simple merchant extraction**: First few words of transaction description
- **Lower confidence score**: 0.3 to indicate fallback processing

## Monitoring and Logging

Enhanced logging provides:
- Batch processing progress
- AI vs fallback processing counts
- Circuit breaker activation notices
- Processing time breakdowns

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test with small datasets (< 30 transactions) - should mostly use AI
2. Test with medium datasets (30-100 transactions) - should use mixed AI/fallback
3. Test with large datasets (> 100 transactions) - should use smart categorization
4. Test with unreliable network conditions - should gracefully degrade to fallback

## Configuration

Key parameters that can be adjusted:
- `MAX_AI_TRANSACTIONS` in smart categorization (currently 50)
- `MAX_AI_CALLS` in regular categorization (currently 30)
- `AI_PROCESSING_TIMEOUT` (currently 60 seconds)
- `MAX_CONSECUTIVE_FAILURES` (currently 3)
- AI timeout values (currently 5 seconds)
- Overall processing timeout (currently 5 minutes)
